# MyNRARifleMatchScoreSheet
The My NRA Rifle Match Score Sheet was created to allow you to keep track of your own results to see if you have been making any progress or if you just had an off day.   Depending on how the match is ran, you might be taking score as it happens from a distance or you might have to walk out to your target and write down your results.   This will also calculate your score per course of fire, and the ending total of the match. For me, by seeing the list of previous matches and the totals helps be determine if I am improving or not, hopefully this app will help you too!
